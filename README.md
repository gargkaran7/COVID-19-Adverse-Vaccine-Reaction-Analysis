# COVID-19-Adverse-Vaccine-Reaction-Analysis

Good vaccine safety and reliability are essential to prevent infectious disease spread. A small but significant number of apparent adverse reactions to the new COVID-19 vaccines have been reported. Here, we aim to identify possible common causes for such adverse reactions with a view to enabling strategies that reduce patients' risk by using patients' data to classify and characterize patients at risk of such reactions.

We started from three raw datasets. We merged them all and cleaned them to eliminate unwanted and raw data. Then we filtered out the data for Los Angeles especially for COVID-19  and performed analysis on various bases. We studied their medical history, no. of people who died, gender, recovery date, etc.

The objective here is to draw conclusions about the adverse effects of the vaccine on the people of Los Angeles from a raw dataset of the United States. We took a whole dataset of the United States from Kaggle containing 3 raw datasets with thousands of rows and cleaned them for unwanted data cleaning empty and duplicate columns and filtering out the data of a single state(Los Angeles).

We successfully concluded and visualized the results. Peaks are showing the most recurrent symptom, who are affected the most whether male or female plotted with their respective ages.
